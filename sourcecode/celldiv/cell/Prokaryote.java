/* The main difference between Prokaryotic cells and Eukaryotic cells
 * is that Proka lack membrance-bound organelles and a true nucleus,
 * while Euka contain membrance-bound organelles, including a true nucleus.
 * 
 * Amitosis (Truc phan)
 * Interphase:
 * - In this phase, the cell grows and replicates its DNA. The DNA is not condensed into chromosomes at this point.
 * Nuclear division:
 * - The nucleus begins to elongate and then constricts in the middle.
 * Cytoplasmic division:
 * - The cytoplasm of the cell is pinched in two along with the nucleus, forming two daughter cells.
